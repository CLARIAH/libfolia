   - added more Feature nodes, like Polarity, Strenght
   - Source, Target, Relation, Predicate, Sentiment Statement,
     Observation Annotations and Layers.
   - Comment node
   - better version checking.(and a bit relaxed too)
* some bug fixes and code improvement.
  - str() works more as expected
  - fixup ref 'id' vs. 'xml:id'

     - small bug fixes

1.0  2016-03-09
[Ko van der Sloot]
